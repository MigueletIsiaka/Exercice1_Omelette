<h3 id="about" class="Heading">What's this all about?</h3>

<p>The CGI functionality allows you to send the score of a quiz
to a PERL CGI script called FormMail.pl. FormMail will then take
that information and send it on to you in an email. If you set
this up properly, then when your student first loads the page, he
or she will be asked to enter a name or other type of
identification (such as a student number). As soon as the
exercise is complete, the student's name or ID, the title of the
exercise, the score, and the start and end times will be sent off
to the CGI script on your server, and the script will send you an
email containing this information.</p>


<h3 id="how">How do I make this work?</h3>
<p><strong>THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF:</strong></p>

<ol type="a">
<li>you have the FormMail.pl PERL script correctly installed on
your server</li>
<li>your exercise is also located on the same server (in other
words, this is not likely to work when the exercise is located on
your desktop computer)</li>
<li>you enter the correct address for your FormMail script, and a
correct email address</li>
</ol>

<p>The first thing you need to do is to find out if FormMail.pl
is installed on your server. FormMail.pl is one of the most
common CGI scripts on the Web, so it's quite likely. If so, then
ask your server administrator to tell you the address.</p>

<p>If FormMail isn't on your server, you can get it free from
here:</p>
<p style="text-align: center'"><a
href="http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/formmail.shtml">http://www.worldwidemart.com/scripts/formmail.shtml</a></p>

<p>You and/or your system administrator will have to read the
instructions in the FormMail package to install and configure
FormMail properly. <strong>We cannot help with this.</strong></p>

<h3 id="support">Why don't you provide support for this?</h3>

<p>Getting this functionality to work properly involves
configuring a PERL script on your server.</p>

<ul>
<li>We didn't write FormMail.</li>
<li>We're not PERL gurus.</li>
<li>We have no control over your server (in fact, you probably
don't either).</li>
</ul>

<p>So this is between you and your system administrator.</p>

<h3 id="more">I want it to do more than this!</h3>

<p>Of course you do. Some people will want to get student names
<em>and</em> ID numbers, some will want a list of questions that
were wrong, some will want the student not to see his or her
score -- the list of possible variations is infinite. What we
have given you is basic CGI functionality; based on our code, and
the instructions of the FormMail.pl script, you will be able to
add any behaviours or features you want, by editing the HotPot
source files (see the Help for information on how the source
files work, and how to edit them). You'll need to learn some HTML 
and JavaScript.</p>

<h3 id="cheating">Can my students cheat?</h3>

<p>Very easily. This is not secure testing. If you need a secure
testing solution, you need to look at server-side products such
as WebCT, QuestionMark and BlackBoard. That's not what HotPot is
for.</p>

<h3 id="failure">I can't get it to work!</h3>

<p>That's a shame. There's not much we can do to help, but you might try the solution below instead.</p>

<h3 id="hotpotnet">This is too complicated! Is there an easy way?</h3>

<p>If you have access to a Moodle server, you can get the <a href="https://moodle.org/plugins/mod_hotpot">HotPot</a> module installed and upload Hot Potatoes exercises into Moodle.</p>
